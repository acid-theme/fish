# Acid for fish

Two flavours: **Acetic** (`#000000`), vibrant, and **Citric** (`#1c1b19`), muted.

Part of [Acid](https://github.com/acid-theme/acid), a very dark colourscheme in two
flavours. The main README lists the other ports.

## Preview

## Install

With fisher:

```fish
fisher install acid-theme/fish
fish_config theme choose "Acid Acetic"
```

`fish_config` writes universal variables, which usually are not committed with a
config. To keep the theme in tracked config instead, use the `conf.d` form,
which sets the same variables globally:

```fish
curl -fsSLo ~/.config/fish/conf.d/acid-acetic.fish \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acid-theme/fish/main/conf.d/acid-acetic.fish
```

Use one or the other, not both.
